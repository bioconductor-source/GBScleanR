\title{GBScleanR: A package to conduct error correction for noisy genotyping by
sequencing (reduced representation sequencing based genotyoing) data.}
\description{
GBScleanR is a package for quality check, filtering, and error correction of
genotype data derived from next generation sequcener (NGS) based genotyping
platforms. GBScleanR takes Variant Call Format (VCF) file as input. The main
function of this package is "clean.geno" which estimates the true genotypes
of samples from given read counts for genotype markers using a hidden Markov
model with incorporating uneven observation ratio of allelic reads. This
implementation gives robust genotype estimation even in noisy genotype data
usually observed in Genotyping-By-Sequnencing (GBS) and similar methods, e.g.
RADseq. GBScleanR currenly only supports genotype data of
biparental populations.
